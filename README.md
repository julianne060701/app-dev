 <p> “Weak Hero Class 1” is a web drama about a seemingly weak, high school student who fights violence inside and outside of the school using his intelligence and fighting skills. This web drama is an adaption of the webtoon “Weak Hero” (약한영웅 in Korean) written by Seopass (서패스) and illustrated by Kim JinSeok (김진석).
   <p>
 <p>  This story is all about Yeon SiEun, a seemingly fragile top 1% model student, who fights violence inside and outside the school with his natural smarts and analysis skills.
    <p>

 <p> This series is all about bullying “Once the bullies target you, it’s game over. The school is run by tyrants whose favorite hobby is tormenting the weakest kids in class. But then Gray (Yeon SiEun) arrived. This mysterious new student threatens to dismantle the established order. He may be small in stature, but his calculative and brutal fighting leaves unsuspecting opponents lying on the floor begging for mercy. Now the school's toughest bullies have to scramble to take down this new and unusual hero.”
